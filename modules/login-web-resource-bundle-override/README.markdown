# Resource Bundle Override

The Resource Bundle Hook sample conveys the recommended approach to override an
application's language keys file for any module that is deployed to Liferay
Portal's OSGi runtime (not applicable to Liferay Portal's core language keys).

For more details on this sample, see the
[Resource Bundle Override](https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/resource-bundle-override)
article on Liferay's Developer Network.
